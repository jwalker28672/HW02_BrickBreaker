To move the paddle hover mouse left or right.
To win break all bricks. Green brick has 1 health and are worth 1 point. Blue bricks have 3 health and are worth 3 points. Red Bricks are indestructable and do not count towards winning.
Power ups include extra lives, enlarge the paddle and shrink the paddle.

Know issues:
There is a glitch that if the ball hits the paddle at a certain angle the ball speed will slow down. This is still a work in progress as to why this is happening.
At this time the extra lives drop seems to drop a lot more than the other 2 i think the drop percentage needs slight tweaking.
Randomly if the ball hits the top row at a certain angle the ball can get trapped. Does not happen all the time so this one is a bit harder to try and chase down.
